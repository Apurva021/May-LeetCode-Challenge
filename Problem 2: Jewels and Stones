In this problem we are given 2 strings J and S. And we have to count the number of characters in the String S which are also present in 
the String J. And this can be efficiently done by making use of a HashSet<Character>. First we add all characters of the String J 
in the set.Initialize a counter=0.Then while iterating over the String S we check if the current character is present in the set. 
If it is present, we increment the counter. And finaly we return the counter.

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(char c:J.toCharArray()) set.add(c);
        
        int ans=0;
        for(char c:S.toCharArray())
        {
            if(set.contains(c)) ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

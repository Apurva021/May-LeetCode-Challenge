In this question first we will iterate over the given string and find the frequency of each charracter present in the string.
We will create and array of size 26 to store the frequency of each character.
Now we will iterate over the string again, and we will return the index of the first character whose frequency is 1.
If no character has frequency 1 then we whave to return -1.

class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        int freq[]=new int[26];
        int ans=-1;
        char ch[]=s.toCharArray();
        for(char c:ch)
        {
            freq[c-'a']++;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<ch.length;++i)
        {
            if(freq[ch[i]-'a']==1)
            {
                ans=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

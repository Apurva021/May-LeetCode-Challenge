In this problem we need to use HashMap<Character,Integer> in order to maintain the frequency of the caracters which are available with
us from the magazine. Then we need to iterate over the ransomNote and check if sufficient number of each type of characters are available
with us to complete the note. 
we need a boolean variable to return the answer. initialy it is kept true, indicating that we can make the ransomNote from magazine.
While iterating overe ransomNote whenever we use a character we reduce its frequency by 1. whenever we encounter a 
character whose frequency is less then 1, we make the boolean variable false.

class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        HashMap<Character,Integer> hm= new HashMap<Character,Integer>();
        
        for(char c:magazine.toCharArray())
        {
            hm.put(c,hm.getOrDefault(c,0)+1);
        }
        
        boolean isPossible=true;
        for(char c:ransomNote.toCharArray())
        {
            if(hm.getOrDefault(c,0)>0)
            {
                hm.put(c,hm.get(c)-1);
            }
            else
            {
                isPossible=false;
            }
        }
        return isPossible;
    }
}
